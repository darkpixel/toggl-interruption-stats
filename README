Yeah, it spits out the data in 'debug'.  This was both a 'proof of concept' and
"I need this report in 30 minutes or we're all dead" thing.

I'll clean it up later and add options to output a nice-looking report for entire teams later.
Maybe even Slack integration so it can be automatically posted to a channel or sent to individuals.
